<h3>
This app was built with Typescript, Node JS and DDD. The main purpose was because I wanted to learn how to create a GraphQL Server.
</h3>

### Running the server

To start the project, run the following commands:

```
npm install && npm run start:dev
```

The server should start at http://localhost:5000/.
